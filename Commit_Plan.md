# Initia



# Merge
Got rid of a Branch that was created on accident and caused Problems with merging our Files.      


# LoadLibary
Created a Class in GameCollection that gets a Array with all the Games a User has in his Steam Libary to acces this Array the User needs to input their SteamID. This Class Uses a Local SteamAPI key which is only good for testing.
